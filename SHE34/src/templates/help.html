                            The process of systematic development of user friendly interfaces or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_engineering">usability engineering</a> involves constant evaluation of a system design through usability tests and inspection methods. Heuristic evaluation (HE) is one of the most important inspection methods in usability engineering, in which a number of usability experts evaluate the user interfaces based on a set of pre-defined principles or the so called <em>"heuristics"</em> and at the end, their findings will be merged in a summary report.</p>
                        <p class="lead-guid">  SHE is tool for supporting the whole process of heuristic evaluation.  It is smart enough to recognize similarities between evaluations and recommend them as a potential merging candidate in the final report.

                            Manager can merge existing evaluations and make merged evaluation. The merging can be done anytime but it is better to be after the deadline of the project. After clicking on the <span class="text-info strong">Merge Evaluations </span>button in the project detail or in the overview of the project in the dashboard merge desktop opens a similar page to the following screenshot. In the first column with the name Evaluations (not merged) you can see all the evaluations which are not already merged, categorized by the name of their evaluators.
